Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how they are stored and how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is the base or mostly used for Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps. 

# What is OpenCV?

OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in today’s systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.

# OpenCV installation on WINDOWS

To install OpenCV, just go to the command-line and type the following command:

- pip install opencv-python

# How Does A Computer Read An Image?

We are humans we can easily make it out that is the image of a person who is me. But if we ask computer “is it my photo?”. The computer can’t say anything because the computer is not figuring out it all on its own. 
The computer reads any image as a range of values between 0 and 255. For any color image, there are 3 primary channels -red, green and blue.

# Applications of OpenCV: 

There are lots of applications which are solved using OpenCV, some of them are listed below 

- face recognition
-	Automated inspection and surveillance
-	Number of people – count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)
-	Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds
-	Interactive art installations
-	Anamoly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)
-	Street view image stitching
-	Video/image search and retrieval
-	Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
-	object recognition
-	Medical image analysis
-	Movies – 3D structure from motion
-	TV Channels advertisement recognition
